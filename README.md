# 3-body

Investigate the dynamics of the 3-body problem

For now, I'll start with having all the Python code in the root of the repository.
If it becomes something to share more widely, I'll reorganize it into a package.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Requirements include pytest, so you can run the tests with

```bash
pytest
```

If you're going to do any development, you should install pre-commit
so the code is formatted before you commit.

```bash
pre-commit install
```
